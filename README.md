 a modern online bookstore built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, Context API, JWT Authentication, Cloudinary, and secure HTTP-only cookies.
 Users can sign up/login, explore books, search instantly, manage their cart, update quantities, add addresses, and place Cash-on-Delivery orders. All routes are protected with secure auth middleware, and the cart stays synced with localStorage for a smooth experience.
 The Admin Panel allows adding books with Cloudinary image uploads, managing inventory, and viewing all orders.
